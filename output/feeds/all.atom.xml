&lt;p&gt;I know that it's been a while since I updated the site but I didn't want to add a new post until I had substantial work done. 
For one, I wanted to redo the site from being made completely static by hand to a staticly assigned site. I was recommened &lt;em&gt;Pelican&lt;/em&gt; by a member of &lt;em&gt;Coffee House Coders&lt;/em&gt;.  Since the only programming language that I've even looked at was Python, I thought it might be a good fit.  There have definately been some challenges, but since it uses &lt;em&gt;bootstrap themes&lt;/em&gt;, it has a good amount of flexability in appearance. I am sure that eventually I will move to some other static generator as people do. Another great feature of Pelican is that it has RSS feed generation built in. This is a feature that I wanted to support as I have been consuming alot of RSS via &lt;em&gt;Newsboat&lt;/em&gt; on *nix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;So besides redoing the site, there are a few other items that I would like to add as well:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A page on media recommenations - books, movies, music, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure RSS is working&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post more regularly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look into hosting on OpenBSD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Potential Future articles:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimal *nix Install Guide - Featuring Arch, OpenBSD and Suckless Utils.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My own Pelican Setup Guide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vim-Plug Guide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

This is the new movie by Studio Trigger, famous for shows such as "Kill la kill", and "Little Witch Academia", and "Gurren Lagan" back when it was Gianax.  I would say that it defianly won points for art style and visual appeal, but it was mostly done in CG which is not my taste generally. I will have to say this is the best example of modern anime using CG that I've seen, but I still don't prefer it. They also had an interesting lack of line work, which the producers talked about being a selling point at the round table after the film, and I think this worked but again, felt like a consession to making the CG animation process easier so as to not have to do so much line work and rely on the models. I am curious as to what other people think on this front as I feel like I am the outlier with my contemporaries, who are more willing to accept the "uncanny-ness" that CG anime provides. 26 As far as the story goes, there isn't one. It definatley seemed like an afterthought. I would say to get the most enjoyment out of this film, just shut the brain off and enjoy the show, thinking too much will just harsh the vibe anyways. All you need to know is flame powers, and anime explosions!  I give it 6.5 Burnish flames out of 10.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category><category term="blogging"></category><category term="anime"></category></entry><entry><title>Drie</title><link href="https://agonser.xyz/articles/2019/09/16/drie/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-09-16T15:32:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-01-20T04:23:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Alexander Gonser</name></author><id>tag:agonser.xyz,2019-09-16:/articles/2019/09/16/drie/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Had a semi productive weekend.

Configured zfs on my server, got my dns records working (You can offically got to agonser.xyz now). I also went to the Japanese cultural festive in Saginaw. That was a lot of fun, should have some pictures up on facebook.  I am currently trying to set up nfs on my the same ubuntu server so I can easily mount and transfer things, in particular from my apple xserve.  The plan is to get everything off of that and onto my new server and then maybe turn the xserve into a xen-server, but I am running into some permissions issues.  My boy Jason showed me this really cool project called ngrok, will be using that to work on things through the coming week.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category><category term="blogging"></category></entry><entry><title>The Deuce</title><link href="https://agonser.xyz/articles/2019/09/11/the-deuce/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-09-11T19:14:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-01-20T04:23:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Alexander Gonser</name></author><id>tag:agonser.xyz,2019-09-11:/articles/2019/09/11/the-deuce/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Post 2: Electric Boogaloo.&lt;br&gt;

Bare with me as I work through what I want this blog to be. Yesterday was pretty cool. I went to my first M/U/G (aka Michigan Unix users Group) meeting. It was a lecture on the life of a "mediocre programmer". Was pretty a pretty cool talk and I won the door prize of the No Starch Press text book, "Elequent Javascript", so hopefully I can use that to make this site better. So here's to that!  In other news I hope to get this docker thing figured out on this digital ocean droplet I purchased the other day.  Having some trouble with it and pushing my changes to github and then getting the makerfile to work correctly after that. Still scratching my head, hopefully I can get some input from the coffee house coders guys.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category><category term="blogging"></category><category term="unix"></category><category term="linux"></category><category term="javascript"></category></entry><entry><title>First Post</title><link href="https://agonser.xyz/articles/2019/09/08/first-post/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-09-08T20:21:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-01-20T04:23:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Alexander Gonser</name></author><id>tag:agonser.xyz,2019-09-08:/articles/2019/09/08/first-post/</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello, world!
