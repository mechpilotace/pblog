&lt;p&gt;This year, one of my resolution is to read more. This has culmunatied into the following "plan" or "challenge". That is to say, I am going to read a book a month for the rest of the year. This started with picking up of Jordan B. Peterson's book &lt;em&gt;12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos&lt;/em&gt;. Which I was able to finish under the wire to complete a book for January. I would like to stick to "non technical" pieces for this, but as I am working on some certifications I figure that sprinkling some in here or there will help me to get through them.
I am also documenting it here so that I can keep myself honest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here be the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January: 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos - Jordan B. Peterson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feburary: Unix and Linux System Administration Handbook, Fifth Ed. - Various [1135 pages or 40 a day]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March: Unsouled: Cradle Volume One - Will Wight [202 pages or 7 a day]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April: The Sailor Who Fell From Grace with the Sea - Yukio Mishima [100  pages or 4 a day]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May: Vacationland - John Hodgman [150  pages or 11 a day]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;June: Antifragile - Nassim Nicholas Taleb [653 pages or 22 a day]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;July: Bakemonogatari Part 1 -  Nisiosin [300  pages or 10 a day]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;August: Boogiepop &amp;amp; Others - Kouhei Kadono (Or whatever the first book is in the series) [174 pages or 6 a day]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;September: The Eye of the Dragon - Stephen King [380 pages or 13 a day]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;October: I, Robot - Isaac Asimov [247 pages or 9 a day]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;November: The Illustrated Man - Ray Bradbury [243 pages or 9 a day]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;December: The Subtle art of not giving a F*ck - Mark Manson [115 pages or 4 a day]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These can be subject to change as some of these books are parts of series and as I build the habbit of reading more. I may add some of the Michael W. Lucas IT Mastery series in here to suppliment some of the month's or others as I hope to "cruze" through the list. As you can see with the break down I added with the pages per day, These should easily be do able and I will probably end up reading more and one a month.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will probably do a monthly check in, to see how this list is changing then a recap at the end of the year.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category><category term="books"></category><category term="goals"></category></entry><entry><title>Site Update &amp; Happy 2020</title><link href="https://agonser.xyz/articles/2020/01/20/site-update-2020/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-01-20T17:25:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-01-20T17:25:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Alexander Gonser</name></author><id>tag:agonser.xyz,2020-01-20:/articles/2020/01/20/site-update-2020/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Happy belated New Years!!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that it's been a while since I updated the site but I didn't want to add a new post until I had substantial work done. 
For one, I wanted to redo the site from being made completely static by hand to a staticly assigned site. I was recommened &lt;em&gt;Pelican&lt;/em&gt; by a member of &lt;em&gt;Coffee House Coders&lt;/em&gt;.  Since the only programming language that I've even looked at was Python, I thought it might be a good fit.  There have definately been some challenges, but since it uses &lt;em&gt;bootstrap themes&lt;/em&gt;, it has a good amount of flexability in appearance. I am sure that eventually I will move to some other static generator as people do. Another great feature of Pelican is that it has RSS feed generation built in. This is a feature that I wanted to support as I have been consuming alot of RSS via &lt;em&gt;Newsboat&lt;/em&gt; on *nix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;So besides redoing the site, there are a few other items that I would like to add as well:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A page on media recommenations - books, movies, music, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure RSS is working&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post more regularly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look into hosting on OpenBSD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Potential Future articles:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimal *nix Install Guide - Featuring Arch, OpenBSD and Suckless Utils.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My own Pelican Setup Guide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vim-Plug Guide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

This is the new movie by Studio Trigger, famous for shows such as "Kill la kill", and "Little Witch Academia", and "Gurren Lagan" back when it was Gianax.  I would say that it defianly won points for art style and visual appeal, but it was mostly done in CG which is not my taste generally. I will have to say this is the best example of modern anime using CG that I've seen, but I still don't prefer it. They also had an interesting lack of line work, which the producers talked about being a selling point at the round table after the film, and I think this worked but again, felt like a consession to making the CG animation process easier so as to not have to do so much line work and rely on the models. I am curious as to what other people think on this front as I feel like I am the outlier with my contemporaries, who are more willing to accept the "uncanny-ness" that CG anime provides. 26 As far as the story goes, there isn't one. It definatley seemed like an afterthought. I would say to get the most enjoyment out of this film, just shut the brain off and enjoy the show, thinking too much will just harsh the vibe anyways. All you need to know is flame powers, and anime explosions!  I give it 6.5 Burnish flames out of 10.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category><category term="blogging"></category><category term="anime"></category></entry><entry><title>Drie</title><link href="https://agonser.xyz/articles/2019/09/16/drie/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-09-16T15:32:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-01-20T04:23:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Alexander Gonser</name></author><id>tag:agonser.xyz,2019-09-16:/articles/2019/09/16/drie/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Had a semi productive weekend.

That was a lot of fun, should have some pictures up on facebook.  I am currently trying to set up nfs on my the same ubuntu server so I can easily mount and transfer things, in particular from my apple xserve.  The plan is to get everything off of that and onto my new server and then maybe turn the xserve into a xen-server, but I am running into some permissions issues.  My boy Jason showed me this really cool project called ngrok, will be using that to work on things through the coming week.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category><category term="blogging"></category></entry><entry><title>The Deuce</title><link href="https://agonser.xyz/articles/2019/09/11/the-deuce/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-09-11T19:14:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-01-20T04:23:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Alexander Gonser</name></author><id>tag:agonser.xyz,2019-09-11:/articles/2019/09/11/the-deuce/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Post 2: Electric Boogaloo.&lt;br&gt;

Bare with me as I work through what I want this blog to be. Yesterday was pretty cool. I went to my first M/U/G (aka Michigan Unix users Group) meeting. It was a lecture on the life of a "mediocre programmer". Was pretty a pretty cool talk and I won the door prize of the No Starch Press text book, "Elequent Javascript", so hopefully I can use that to make this site better. So here's to that!  In other news I hope to get this docker thing figured out on this digital ocean droplet I purchased the other day.  Having some trouble with it and pushing my changes to github and then getting the makerfile to work correctly after that. Still scratching my head, hopefully I can get some input from the coffee house coders guys.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category><category term="blogging"></category><category term="unix"></category><category term="linux"></category><category term="javascript"></category></entry><entry><title>First Post</title><link href="https://agonser.xyz/articles/2019/09/08/first-post/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-09-08T20:21:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-01-20T04:23:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Alexander Gonser</name></author><id>tag:agonser.xyz,2019-09-08:/articles/2019/09/08/first-post/</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello, world!
