## Happy belated New Years!!

I know that it's been a while since I updated the site but I didn't want to add a new post until I had substantial work done. 
For one, I wanted to redo the site from being made completely static by hand to a staticly assigned site. I was recommened _Pelican_ by a member of _Coffee House Coders_.  Since the only programming language that I've even looked at was Python, I thought it might be a good fit.  There have definately been some challenges, but since it uses _bootstrap themes_, it has a good amount of flexability in appearance. I am sure that eventually I will move to some other static generator as people do. Another great feature of Pelican is that it has RSS feed generation built in. This is a feature that I wanted to support as I have been consuming alot of RSS via _Newsboat_ on *nix. 


#### So besides redoing the site, there are a few other items that I would like to add as well:

* A page on media recommenations - books, movies, music, etc
* Make sure RSS is working
* Post more regularly
* Look into hosting on OpenBSD

#### Potential Future articles:

* Minimal *nix Install Guide - Featuring Arch, OpenBSD and Suckless Utils.
* My own Pelican Setup Guide
* Vim-Plug Guide

##### Links that made this possible:
