Just started the new project of adding and managing my dotfiles on github.  I have the goal of adding some creature comforts and IDE like usage to Vim at first and then we'll see how it goes from there. I decided to use vim-plug as my plugin manager, as that seems to be a pretty popular one at the moment. Gotta start thinking about those cool color schemes!
