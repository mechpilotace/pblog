Had a semi productive weekend. Configured zfs on my server, got my dns records working (You can offically got to agonser.xyz now). I also went to the Japanese cultural festive in Saginaw. That was a lot of fun, should have some pictures up on facebook.  I am currently trying to set up nfs on my the same ubuntu server so I can easily mount and transfer things, in particular from my apple xserve.  The plan is to get everything off of that and onto my new server and then maybe turn the xserve into a xen-server, but I am running into some permissions issues.  My boy Jason showed me this really cool project called ngrok, will be using that to work on things through the coming week.
