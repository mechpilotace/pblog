Post 2: Electric Boogaloo.  
Bare with me as I work through what I want this blog to be. Yesterday was pretty cool. I went to my first M/U/G (aka Michigan Unix users Group) meeting. It was a lecture on the life of a "mediocre programmer". Was pretty a pretty cool talk and I won the door prize of the No Starch Press text book, "Elequent Javascript", so hopefully I can use that to make this site better. So here's to that!  In other news I hope to get this docker thing figured out on this digital ocean droplet I purchased the other day.  Having some trouble with it and pushing my changes to github and then getting the makerfile to work correctly after that. Still scratching my head, hopefully I can get some input from the coffee house coders guys.
